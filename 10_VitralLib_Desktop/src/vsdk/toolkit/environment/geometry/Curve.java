    This method is provided to ease the integration with generic operation
    Geometry.doIntersection.  A default behavior of not responding the test
    is provided here for 1-dimensional forms. Note that a Loft creation
    between current curve and a circle curve for emulating a tube like
    structure, gives as a result a 2-dimensional Surface, from which a
    Loft.doIntersection operation will give similar results to that
    expected from this 1-dimensional case. However, as real mathematical
    1-dimensional objects are infinitively thin, a doIntersection operation
    will always fail as the operation is regularized for constructive
    solid modelling compatible interpretation.
